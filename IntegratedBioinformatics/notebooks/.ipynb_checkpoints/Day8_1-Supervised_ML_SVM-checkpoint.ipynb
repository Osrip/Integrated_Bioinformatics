    "Having explored some unsupervised machine learning methods earlier, we will move on to supervised techniques. Supervised learning is the task of finding a mapping from input data to output labels based on example input-output pairs. During the training (or fitting) phase, the model builds an internal function which maps input to output, ideally in a way that can be generalized to yet-unseen data successfully. Once a model is trained, it can be used to predict output labels from new input data alone.\n",

    "Our first dataset, like yesterday, will be the mice gene expression data on the input side, and the categorical diet labels on the output (also referred to as \"target\") side. The first supervised model that we will train and evaluate will be a support vector classifier."
